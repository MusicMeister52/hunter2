Launching an Environment
========================

Development Environment
-----------------------

Hunter 2 requires docker engine 17.05 or greater to build. Check docker engine version using the following command:
```shell
docker version
```

Link the development compose file:
```shell
ln -s docker-compose.dev.yml docker-compose.yml
```
This environment maps the local repo into the container and will dynamically reload code changes.

Build the container images:
```shell
docker-compose build
```

You will need to configure some hosts file entries for the wildcard DNS:
```shell
echo 127.0.0.1 hunter2.local www.hunter2.local dev.hunter2.local >> /etc/hosts
```
`dev.hunter2.local` is the default event subdomain. If you are working with more events add more names here.

Launch the containers and configure the database tables:
```shell
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose run --rm app migrate_schemas
```

To create the base objects run the following:
```shell
docker-compose run --rm app setupsite
docker-compose run --rm app createsuperuser
docker-compose run --rm app createevent
```

Load an event page (such as [http://dev.hunter2.local:8080/hunt/](http://dev.hunter2.local:8080/hunt/)) and log in.
This implicitly creates a profile for you, and then you can strugle make an admin team.

### Profiling ###
To enable performance profiling with silk, do:
```shell
echo 'H2_SILK=True' >> .env
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose run --rm app migrate_schemas
```

Production Environment
----------------------

Link the production compose file:
```shell
ln -s docker-compose.prod.yml docker-compose.yml
```

Launch the containers and configure the database tables:
```shell
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose run --rm app migrate_schemas
```

To create the base objects run the following:
```shell
docker-compose run --rm app setupsite
docker-compose run --rm app createsuperuser
docker-compose run --rm app createevent
```

Development Process
-------------------

To manipulate the Python dependencies you need to run `poetry`. The easiest way to do this is from the latest python build container as follows:
```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.check.yml run --rm poetry ...
```
