Setup
=====

Development Environment
-----------------------

### Prerequisites

Hunter 2 requires the following minimum versions to build:
| Dependency     | Version |
| -------------- | ------- |
| docker-engine  | 18.09   |
| docker-compose | 1.25.1  |

We need to export some variables to enable the build features we are using:
```shell
export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
```

### Build and Launch the Application

Start from within a clone of the repository.

Link the development compose file:
```shell
ln -s docker-compose.dev.yml docker-compose.yml
```
This environment maps the local repo into the container and will dynamically reload code changes.

If your OS doesn't resolve localhost domains automatically you may need to configure some hosts file entries, as the app uses DNS information to route to different events:
```shell
echo 127.0.0.1 hunter2.localhost www.hunter2.localhost dev.hunter2.localhost | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```
`dev.hunter2.localhost` is the default event subdomain. If you are working with more events, add more names here.

The quickest way to build and launch is:

```shell
make run
```

This can always be used to build any out of date images and restart everything that needs restarting.
You can always use `docker-compose` directly:

```shell
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

To create the database tables and base objects run the following:
```shell
docker-compose run --rm app migrate_schemas
docker-compose run --rm app setupsite
docker-compose run --rm app createsuperuser
docker-compose run --rm app createevent
```

Production Environment
----------------------

Link the production compose file:
```shell
ln -s docker-compose.prod.yml docker-compose.yml
```

Production environments require configuration of passwords for database users. Add the following to your `.env` file:
```
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password for DB superuser>
H2_DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password for hunter2 DB user>
H2_DB_EXPORTER_PASSWORD=<password for metrics exporter DB user>
```

You can generate random credentials for both these users with something like
```
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 99 | head -n 1)" >> .env
echo "H2_DATABASE_PASSWORD=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 99 | head -n 1)" >> .env
echo "H2_DB_EXPORTER_PASSWORD=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 99 | head -n 1)" >> .env
```

Launch the containers and configure the database tables:
```shell
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "/opt/hunter2/venv/bin/python manage.py" app migrate_schemas
```

You can now remove the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` from your `.env` file and store it safely for future use.

To create the base objects run the following:
```shell
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "/opt/hunter2/venv/bin/python manage.py" app setupsite
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "/opt/hunter2/venv/bin/python manage.py" app createsuperuser
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "/opt/hunter2/venv/bin/python manage.py" app createevent
```
